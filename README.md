# What is Twitter Scraping?
  Scraping is a technique to get information from Social Network sites. Scraping Twitter can yield many insights into sentiments, opinions and social media trends. Analysing tweets, shares, likes, URLs and interests is a powerful way to derive insight into public conversations.
  It is legal to scrape Twitter or any other SNS(Social Networking Sites) to extract publicly available information, but you should be aware that the data extracted might contain personal data.
  
# How to Scrape the Twitter Data?
  Scraping can be done with the help of many opensource libraries like 
	
  1. Tweepy
  2. Twint
  3. Snscrape
  4. Getoldtweets3
  
	For my project I have used SNSCRAPE library.
   
# Libraries and Modules needed for the project!

	1. snscrape.modules.twitter - (To Scrape the Data from Twitter)
	2. Pandas - (To Create a DataFrame with the scraped data)
	3. Pymongo - (To upload the dataframe to MongoDB database)
	4. Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)
	

# Snscrape
  Snscrape allows you to scrape basic information such as a user's profile, tweet content, source, and so on. Snscrape is not limited to Twitter, but can also scrape content from other prominent social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and others. Its advantages are that there are no limits to the number of tweets you can retrieve or the window of tweets (that is, the date range of tweets). So Snscrape allows you to retrieve old data.

# Streamlit
  Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. Streamlit allows you to re-use any Python code you have already written. This can save considerable amounts of time compared to non-Python based tools where all code to create visualizations needs to be re-written.
  
  In my project I've extensively used streamlit API Reference feature for creation of Titles, Images, Headers, Input boxes, Buttons, Checkbox, Download buttons.
